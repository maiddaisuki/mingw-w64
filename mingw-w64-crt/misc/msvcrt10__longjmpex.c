  /* msvcrt10 longjmp() for non-zero bufptr->Registration is unconditionally
   * calling local_unwind2() with bufptr->Registration as SEH establisher frame
   * and with bufptr->TryLevel as try level.
   *
   * msvcrt10 local_unwind2() is expecting that the passed SEH establisher frame
   * is of msvcrt10 format which contains additional fields: scope table and try level.
   * It will do nothing if the SEH establisher frame's try level is -1 or if it is
   * same as passed try level from function argument. Otherwise it will dereference
   * scope table pointer and calls specified unwind handlers.
   *
   * Therefore the msvcrt10 longjmp() can be called only if the bufptr->Registration
   * is valid SEH establisher frame in msvcrt10 format (with additional fields).
   * All SEH handlers registered by mingw-w64 are just standard SEH establisher
   * frame structure without any additional msvcrt10 fields. To prevent using and
   * dereferencing the scope table pointer (which is after the standard SEH
   * establisher frame), set the bufptr->TryLevel to value which msvcrt10
   * local_unwind2() function reads, to the value from address where is the
   * try level in the msvcrt10 SEH establisher frame format. It is some value
   * on the stack which does not belong to the SEH establisher frame, but reading
   * it should not cause any memory corruption.
   *
   * As msvcrt10 longjmp() does not support bufptr->Cookie and bufptr->UnwindFunc
   * fields, for the non-zero bufptr->UnwindFunc case, it is needed to do all
   * unwinds manually. msvcrt10 longjmp() is always calling the _global_unwind2(),
   * but the bufptr->UnwindFunc has to be called after _global_unwind2().
   * As _global_unwind2() is unregistering SEH handler (up to the specified one),
   * it is idempotent and so can be called multiple times.
